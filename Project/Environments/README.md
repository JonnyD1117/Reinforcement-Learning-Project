## Stable-Baselines3 (Stable & Optimized DRL algorithms) 

StableBaselines3 is a library which using *PyTorch* as the backend for implementing deep reinforcement learning algorithms. These algorithms are very stable, have been optimized, and are fully featured with a host of capabilities not available in the vanilla version of these algorithms. 



To install this package, run the following code... 

```
pip install stable-baselines3[extra]
```
